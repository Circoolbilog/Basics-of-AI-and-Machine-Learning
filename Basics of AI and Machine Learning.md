If you noticed, Congratulations! You most likely have used ChatGPT or similar tools. --

Since we're talking about AI today I thought it fitting to introduce everyone to this topic. I want to first talk about the use of AI in today's World.

# AI in Today's World:

A few years ago, when the word AI or Artificial Intelligence were to be mentioned, most people would usually think of futuristic concepts portrayed in science fiction movies like the terminator. Others, the more technologically aware would probably think of the early AI assistants like Siri, or other existing technology at the time. Today, A lot of companies use AI mainly as a marketing buzzword. "AI powered search engine," "AI powered appliances," I even saw an ad about a "ChatGPT E-Bike!" There is a lot of confusion today with AI, my hope is that by the end of this, you all will armed with the knowledge to navigate the ever changing world dominated by AI and be inspired to venture to the world of AI Research and Development.

## Machine Vision / Computer Vision

One of the most popular branches of Artificial Intelligence right now, this is also the branch of machine learning where my current work is related to. Computer vision helps computers understand digital videos and images. 

Some examples of Computer vision:
- Facial Recognition- Used in Various applications including but not limited to: Security Systems, Access control, and authentication processes
- Object Detection/Tracking - Surveillance and Security systems used computer vision technology for monitoring and analyzing video footage
- Image Classification - Image Classification is widely used in medical images for diagnosing conditions, Quality control in manufacturing, Content moderation for Social Media, and Plant/Animal identification
- Optical Character Recognition - Used in Document Digitization, Automatic License Plate Recognition, and Handwritten Text Recognition

Here's an excellent example of computer vision right in your pocket. If you have an android phone, you can open up google lens, where you can see some of the applications for computer vision. "Translate", "Text", and "Homework" are all examples of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR enables computers to extract text from images to which google can then process the text depending on your needs. The other features of the google lens use different applications of Computer Vision like Object recognition.

## Generative AI
While Computer Vision uses Machine Learning to help computers understand and interpret the world through digital Images, Generative AI is focused on creative endeavors. Generative AI, much like computer vision is a broad term that encompasses a variety of techniques designed to generate new content such as text, images, audio, or other types of data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Diffusion Models are examples of Generative AI. They are trained to understand and replicate underlying patterns and structures present in the training data allowing them to create "new" content that is similar but not too identical to the original data.

### Diffusion Models



And those are just some examples of AI in today's world
# A Brief History of AI


# What is the Difference Between AI and Machine Learning?

![[AI-ML_DL.png]]
**Artificial Intelligence** - The ability of a computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with the intellectual processes characteristics of humans.
**Machine Learning** - Constantly improving a machine through tweaking of parameters based on experience which imitates the way humans learn. 
**Deep Learning** - A sub type of ML that uses Neural Networks. it uses a network of Nodes called "neurons" designed after the human brain.
