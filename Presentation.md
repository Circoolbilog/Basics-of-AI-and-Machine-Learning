### Neural networks
Structure of a Neural Network

---
### Components of a Neural Network:

1. **Neurons:** Neurons are the basic processing units of a neural network.
2. **Weights:** Weights represent the strength of connections between neurons. 
3. **Biases:** Biases provide flexibility to the neural network by shifting the activation function horizontally.

---
4. **Activation Functions:** Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network, enabling it to learn complex patterns. 
5. **Loss Function:** The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output of the neural network and the actual output.
