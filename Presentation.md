## Supervised Learning
![supervised-learning](supervised-learning.png)
trained on labeled datasets

---
### Classification
![classification](Classification.png)
classifying objects

---
### Regression
![regression](Regression.png)
used to predict continuous values

---
## Unsupervised Learning
![unsupervised-learning.png](unsupervised-learning.png)
Deals with unlabeled data

---
### Clustering
a way of grouping similar data points together. 

---
### Association
discovering the relation between variables in large datasets.

---

## Reinforcement Learning
![[Reinforcement Learning.png]]
through trial and error

### Neural networks
Structure of a Neural Network
![](Neural-Networks-Architecture.png)

---
### Components of a Neural Network:

1. **Neurons:** Neurons are the basic processing units of a neural network.
2. **Weights:** Weights represent the strength of connections between neurons. 
3. **Biases:** Biases provide flexibility to the neural network by shifting the activation function horizontally.

---
4. **Activation Functions:** Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network, enabling it to learn complex patterns. 
5. **Loss Function:** The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output of the neural network and the actual output.
