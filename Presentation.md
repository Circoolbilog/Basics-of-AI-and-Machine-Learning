# A Brief History of AI

---
### 1. The Early Days of AI
#### 1.1. The Birth of AI (1940s - 1956)
- **1943:** Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed a model of artificial neurons. 
- **1947:** Alan Turing discussed computer intelligence and self-altering machines. 
- **1950:** Claude Shannon created "Theseus," the first AI system.
- **1956:** John McCarthy organized the Dartmouth Conference, marking the birth of AI.

---
### 2. The Emergence of Machine Learning

#### 1.2. The Rise of Machine Learning (Late 1950s - 1959)
- **Late 1950s:** Arthur Samuel introduced the term "Machine Learning" 
- **1958:** FORTRAN, the first programming language for scientific computing
- **1959:** John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky founded the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project

---
### 3. The Evolution of AI and ML

#### 1.3. Progress in AI and ML (1960s - 1990s)
- **1967:** General Problem Solver (GPS) was developed.
- **1970:** The first computer vision system was created
- **Late 1970s:** Emergence of connectionism
- **1980s:** Introduction of the backpropagation algorithm. 
- **1997:** IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in chess.

## Neural networks
### Structure of a Neural Network

---
### Components of a Neural Network:

1. **Neurons:** Neurons are the basic processing units of a neural network.
2. **Weights:** Weights represent the strength of connections between neurons. 
3. **Biases:** Biases provide flexibility to the neural network by shifting the activation function horizontally.
4. **Activation Functions:** Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network, enabling it to learn complex patterns. 
5. **Loss Function:** The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output of the neural network and the actual output.
